### Hey! ⭐️
My name is Cole Lewis, I am a Computer Science student at the University of South Carolina and am graduating in December 2022!

Currently, I am learning ReactJS and adjacent web-frameworks to construct progressive web applications.

I am interested in developing robust applications that can compare to the performance and utility of traditional desktop applications. As mobile/low-performance devices become increasingly common as alternatives to desktop computers, it is important that the same sort of software become available by the most ubiquitous point of access in our daily lives: the web browser.

Feel free to reach out for collaboration, opportunities, or, just to say hello either here or at my [email](mailto:cloudylint@protonmail.com)!
