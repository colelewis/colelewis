### Hey!
My name is Cole, I'm a Computer Science student graduating in December 2022.  

I am an aspiring Ethereum developer and am hoping to make a career of blockchain development.

Currently, I am learning ReactJS and how to construct progressive web applications.

Feel free to reach out for collaboration, opportunities, or, just to say hello either here or at my [email](mailto:cloudylint@protonmail.com)!
