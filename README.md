### Hey! ⭐️
My name is Cole Lewis, I am a full-stack developer specializing in Angular, Python (Flask/Django), and data analysis!

I'm interested in pursuing functional programming, and machine learning!

A lot of my repos will have the word "pocket" somewhere in the name since the size/utility of each one is like something small and simple like you'd carry around in your pocket!

colelewis/colelewis is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
