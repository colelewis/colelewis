### Hey! ⭐️
My name is Cole Lewis, I am a Computer Science student at the University of South Carolina and am graduating in December 2022.

Currently, I am learning Haskell!

I'm interested in pursuing full-stack web development, functional programming, and machine learning!

A lot of my repos will have the word "pocket" somewhere in the name since the size/utility of each one is like something small and simple like you'd carry around in your pocket! 

Feel free to reach out for collaboration, answers to questions, or, just to say hello either here or at my [email](mailto:cole.g.lewis@gmail.com)!
